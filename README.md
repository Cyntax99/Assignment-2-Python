# Assignment-2-Python

This program will use as its primary resource a file of tuition cost data for US States for recent years. The input file is us_avg_tuition.csv and is available in the Blackboard folder for this assignment.
Specific Program Behavior
1. The program will read in the data file. This will give it the data it needs to answer
the different types of user queries.
2. The program will then operate in a loop. In the loop, the user can specify three
different types of queries.
a. Whole US data.
b. Data for a specified US State
c. Exit the program
The queries are detailed as follows: o Specified State Data:
o o o o
o Whole o
For the specified State, please report
The overall average tuition cost for the years covered. Theaveragerisebetweenyearsfortheyearscovered. A prediction for the next year’s tuition based upon:
§ The tuition rise for the last year,
§ The average tuition rise for the years covered. US data:
Same data as for a State (see above), but averaging all the States to create US
data. o Exit
o o
If the user requests the program exit, the program terminates. Otherwise it goes back into the loop prompting the user for its query.
Requirements:
• You must organize this as an object-oriented program. That is, your data must be defined as classes, and objects based upon those classes used.
• You may not use packages such as numpy, pandas, etc. You may use simple mechanisms, such as csv to read in data.
INF 405 PA2 v2020 10 01 Fall 2020
• The program must be organized using multiple code files (e.g. modules, packages). A single file program is not permitted.
• There will be an intermediate deadline of October 8, 2020. On that date, you must turn in the work you have done to that point. This is to establish that the program has been organized, planned, and thought out. This is in contrast to doing it at the last minute. The things you should emphasize for the intermediate deadline are:
o Theclassesforyourdata
o The overall logical architecture of the program.
This submission will not be graded for code correctness, execution, etc. The purpose is to encourage you to plan the assignment. The intermediate submission will be worth 20% of the overall value of PA2.
• (Optional) If you want, you can do the user interface using a GUI, rather than text- based. This would be worth an additional 10%.
Hints:
• The individual underlying problems here are not difficult one-by-one. The main complexity is that there is a lot going on. You will have to be organized, especially in your initial design of the program to keep things clear.
• Please check the Discussion Board for this program for questions and answers, clarifications, etc.
Notes
• The program should use comments to describe its overall operation and to identify the specific operation of significant lines in the code.
• This is an individual assignment, so please do your own work. Except as explicitly noted, no collaborating with others, looking up or soliciting answers from the internet or other sources.
• If you have difficulties, please use the Discussion Board set up for the assignment on Blackboard, ask questions, or see the instructor.
• Please follow the submission details given below to get credit for this program.
